                    <ul id="CAREER AS  SCIENTIST">

                        After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical
                        Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press
                        Information
                        Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research &
                        Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained
                        unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[26] Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram
                        Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13] He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G.
                        S.
                        Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).[27] In 1969,
                        Kalam
                        was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project
                        director
                        of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini
                        satellite
                        in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project
                        independently at DRDO in 1965.[1] In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded
                        the
                        programme to include more engineers.[25]


                        Kalam addresses engineering students at IIT Guwahati
                        In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space
                        Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.[11][28] Between the 1970s and
                        1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III
                        projects, both of which proved to be successful.
